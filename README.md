# Belly_Button_Challenge

## Overview
In this activity I was tasked with collecting bacteria data from numerous individuals.  ID numbers were used to determine which individual was being discussed.   The goal was to see what types of bacteria lived in the belly button of each of these individuals. The following things were done to retrieve and present the data:
- A dropdown menu was created so that the website user could select different ID numbers.  When the number is selected, all page information changes to the match the number.
- Directly underneath the dropdown menu is the demographic information of that ID number
- To the side of the demographic information is a bubble chart showing all of the bacteria found inside this individual's belly button.  The larger the circle, the more of that bacteria was found.
- The bar graph underneath the bubble chart shows the top ten most frequently found bacteria in this belly button
- The gauge diagram located in the bottom right shows how many times per week this individual cleans out his/her belly button

## Changes made
I made the following changes to the original webpage
- I changed the layout of the page by putting the bubble chart above the bar graph and gauge diagram
- I made the background color of the page a light gray
- I wrote short descriptions underneath each graph/diagram
- I put in a background image on the jumbotron (top of page) and also changed that font color to yellow so that it can be read.
